    Design has always fascinated me. My uncle is an exhibition designer, he got into design at a time when people in India
    had no idea of what it was, growing up around him I was exposed to the depth and the brilliance of the field. I had a
    natural inclination towards drawing art but being around him expanded my passion to encompass the filed of design in its
    entirety. I gave up drawing art back as a child when I moved to Pune, I simply got too busy trying to fit in, so when an
    opportunity to work as a graphic designer was presented to me in my freshman year of college, I took it. It was a
    calling I think, which I answered, and now that I look back I am so glad I did.

    Caption for the above image: Android Wear was quite the thing then, so i decided to use that for the countdown poster.
    Also went well with the overall technical theme of the event.

    Caption: This was the cover image for our app on the Play Store. This was a fest put together entirely by students in
    their freshmen year. It allowed us to transition into the college culture, get to know each other, make memories and
    friendships. That is what the colors represent.

    Winter 2015

    In the winter of 2015, I received a message from a representative of the Pune Chapter of this organization called Make a
    Difference. They were looking for a Graphic Designer and wondered if I would be interested in coming in for an
    interview. They had seen the work I had done for Spectrum 2015 and thought I might be a good fit. I agreed. A week later
    I was driving down to the venue, little did I know this would turn out to be the best decision I ever made in my college
    life.

    Caption: When I applied for a graphic designer position at MAD, I was given a task which would decide whether I was
    suited for the position or not. The task was to design a graphic for a fictional Driving Happiness campaign.The posters
    above and below were my entries. I was accepted :)
