    Hello world!
    My name is Abdul Wasay. I believe in the power of technology to inspire communities, empower people and advance humanity. 
    And I've been working on towards these goals of mine since my undergrad days.

    I am currently a 1st year grad student at the University of Michigan studying Information Science with a focus in Applied Data Science and Social Computing.
