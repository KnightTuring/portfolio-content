            Hi, thanks for dropping by. My name's Abdul and I am from the beautiful city of Pune in India. I am passionate about
            harnessing technology towards the betterment and advancement of humanity.
            
            I graduated in August 2018 with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering and then worked as a Senior Software
            Engineer at Persistent Systems. Currently, I live in Ann Arbor where I'm a graduate student at the University of
            Michigan-School of Information studying Information Science with a focus on Applied Data Science and Social Computing.
            
            Among my personal interests, I have a fascination for astronomy and closely follow developments in the field of space
            technology, clean energy, and the origins of our universe.
            
            In my free time, you will find me curled up reading just about anything or learning to play the guitar :)
